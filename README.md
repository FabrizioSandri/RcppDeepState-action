# RcppDeepState action
This repository contains the implementation of a GitHub Action for RcppDeepState. You can use this Action to launch RcppDeepState in any Rcpp-based projects hosted on GitHub.

RcppDeepState is a fuzz testing library made as a composition of three tools: Rcpp, DeepState and Valgrind. You can use RcppDeepState to fuzz test your R library's C++ code in order to find more subtle bugs like memory leaks or even more general memory errors.
